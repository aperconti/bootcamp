// Array of student names
var students = ["Johnny", "Tyler", "Bodhi", "Pappas"];

// This function will be called for each element in the array

// Loop through each student name and call the printName function

// `forEach` automatically iterates (loops) through each item andcalls the supplied function for that item.
// This is equivalent to the for loop above.

// You can also define an anonymous function inline
