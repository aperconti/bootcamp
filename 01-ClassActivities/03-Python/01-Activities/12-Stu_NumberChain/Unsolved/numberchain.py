# Using a while loop, ask the user "How many numbers?", then print out a chain of ascending numbers, starting at 0.
# After the results have printed ask the user if they would like to continue.
# If "y", restart the process, starting at 0 again.
# If "n", exit the chain.
# Loop while a condition is being met
