# Reddit Scraper

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will scrape the Programmer-Humor.html file provided

* Use Beautiful Soup to scrape only threads that have twenty or more comments, then print the thread's title, number of comments, and the URL to the thread.

## Bonus

* If you finish early, try to display each thread's top comment in your output!

* Visit the [currently active reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/) from which this content was sourced, and see if you can figure out why we aren't directly scraping the live website in this activity.
